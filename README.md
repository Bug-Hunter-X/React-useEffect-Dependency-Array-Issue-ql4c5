# React useEffect Dependency Array Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook:  incorrectly specifying or omitting the dependency array. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially infinite renders.

## Bug
The `bug.jsx` file contains code with an improper `useEffect` dependency array. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.jsx` file shows the correct implementation of the `useEffect` hook's dependency array, fixing the issue.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd react-useEffect-bug`
3. Start the development server using your preferred React development environment (e.g., Vite, Create React App).
